# @threebow/raydium-sdk

This is a fork of Raydium SDK intended to make it work properly on the backend with Node, seeing as it has some issues
running properly with ES modules.

## Usage

1. `pnpm add @threebow/raydium-sdk`
2. Use `@threebow/raydium-sdk` instead of `@raydium-io/raydium-sdk` in your backend node app.
